//! Server-side challenge phrase generator (master-list #89, v3).
//!
//! Picks 5 random words from `word_dict::WORDS` — a curated dictionary of
//! 1,357 neutral/positive English words (4-8 letters, 1-3 syllables, no
//! homophones, no substring collisions). The same dictionary is vendored
//! into `entros-validation/src/word_dict.rs` so the validator knows what the
//! executor could have issued; the two files are kept in sync by the
//! shared curation script at `entros-validation/scripts/curate-dictionary.py`.
//!
//! Why server-issued rather than client-issued: without server issuance,
//! phrase content binding is trivially defeated — an attacker submits
//! their own phrase matching whatever audio they captured. Server-issued
//! phrases are bound to the challenge nonce at
//! `executor-node/src/challenge/registry.rs` and verified by the
//! validation service against submitted audio.
//!
//! Output shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! "elephant mountain coffee yellow bicycle"
//! ```
