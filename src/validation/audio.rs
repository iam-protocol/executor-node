/// OBSERVE / TELEMETRY ONLY — do not treat as an authoritative anti-spoof gate.
/// These signals are computed client-side in the browser and reported by the
/// SDK, so an adversary controlling the client can forge them (a bot simply
/// reports in-range values). The un-forgeable acoustic check is computed
/// server-side by the validation service from the raw audio it already
/// receives. Wiring that server-side score into the composite is a tracked
/// follow-up. Thresholds below are
/// uncalibrated starting points.
///
/// Physical microphones picking up human speech in ambient room acoustics exhibit:
/// - Spectral flatness between 0.015 and 0.85. Flatness < 0.015 indicates pure synthetic
///   tones / degenerate digital signals. Flatness > 0.85 indicates pure white-noise injection.
/// - Spectral centroid between 100 Hz and 6000 Hz. Centroid < 100 Hz indicates a
///   low-frequency DC offset / line hum. Centroid > 6000 Hz indicates an unnaturally
///   bright, high-frequency-dominant spectrum atypical of human speech in room acoustics
///   (speech centroid typically sits ~500-3000 Hz).
/// - Virtual device drivers (e.g. BlackHole, VB-Cable, Soundflower) set `virtual_device = true`.
